    "1. Improved performance: Multithreading allows for concurrent execution of multiple tasks, which can lead \n",
    "to improved performance and faster completion of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Resource utilization: Multithreading allows for better utilization of system resources, such as CPU \n",
    "and memory, by efficiently distributing tasks among multiple threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Responsiveness: Multithreading can enhance the responsiveness of an application by allowing it to\n",
    "continue executing other tasks while waiting for certain operations to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modularity: Multithreading allows for modular design and implementation of complex systems by dividing\n",
    "them into smaller, more manageable threads that can run concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Enhanced user experience: Multithreading can improve the user experience by providing smoother and more\n",
    "responsive interfaces, especially in applications that involve heavy computations or I/O operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "1. Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity in terms of synchronization, resource sharing, and \n",
    "potential race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Debugging and testing: Debugging and testing multithreaded applications can be more challenging due to\n",
    "the non-deterministic nature of thread execution and potential concurrency issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overhead: Multithreading can introduce overhead in terms of memory usage and context switching between\n",
    "threads, which can impact performance if not managed efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalability limitations: In some cases, multithreading may not provide significant performance benefits\n",
    "due to limitations in hardware resources or the nature of the task itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Portability: Multithreading can introduce portability issues, as different operating systems and \n",
